# [============> Prerequisites <============]

- A working 32 or 64 bit Windows computer (no Linux support sadly :( but I might add it in the future).
- Visual Studio Code or Discord installed(I will add discord support in a future update).
- A CSS loader/injector. [Refer to the "What's this?" section to learn more](#VSCodeExtension).
- A mouse(computer mouse) and keyboard(to type in the console once I make it work with Discord).
- A brain or an AI that can interpret this readme file, in case you are the latter, greetings fellow
  non-human.

# [============> Installation <============]

1. Download the zip file and extract it anywhere you like
2. Open glasscord_installer.exe
3. Profit

Optional: Make a shortcut to the file on your desktop so you dont have to be searching for it whenever
you need it. Make sure you don't COPY the file because glasscord.asar needs to be in the same location
as the executable.

# [============> What's this? <============]

This is a Glasscord installer/reinstaller for Visual Studio Code and Discord(not supported at the moment).
The purpose of this program is to copy/create necessary files whenever you execute it in the case that a
software update breaks your glasscord integration. It is also designed for new users that just want to get
glasscord installed without the hassle of manually doing each thing.

This first version I consider it a complete program; however, there are some caveats and features still to
be implemented:

* This first version won't install the required CSS file in the .vscode folder to make it work (I'm working
  on this feature atm).
* You also need an [extension that lets you inject CSS files into VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css).

For more information about Glasscord [go here](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord). Thank you AryToNeX for making this amazing piece of software.
There's also an [official installer](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscordify) available but only works on Linux at the moment.

# [=========> Feature Checklist <=========]
- [X] Add VSCode/Discord directory checks
- [ ] Discord support and ability to choose desired program
- [ ] Separate redundant operations into functions
- [ ] Create .css file in the vs code user dir if not present
- [ ] Linux support... maybe?
- [ ] Implement a GUI?

# [=============> Some Facts <=============]

- I'm currently a Computer Science student on my first year at the University of Central Florida. 
  Since I dont have much experience, this code is far from perfect and if you got something to 
  share, feel free to contribute.
- This small project took me approximately 2-3 full days of work(around 20-24 hours) because I 
  had to relearn a ton of stuff and because I work really slow, but it was a satisfying journey 
  at the end.
